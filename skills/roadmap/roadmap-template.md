Roadmap structure `/roadmap` writes to — the templates/examples referenced from `SKILL.md` (sub-task format, the full roadmap Markdown, and the completion report block). These are reference material read while writing the roadmap; all rules and guidance live in `SKILL.md`.

## Standard sub-task table

Standard sub-tasks (drop any that don't apply, add feature-specific ones), in **UI-first order** within the feature:

| # | Sub-task | Command + prompt to paste |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Decision (ADR)** — only if `Needs ADR? = yes` | `/architect <feature> — <the specific decisions: composition/sections · provider · data model · behavior>` |
| 2 | **UI (placeholder data)** | `/develop <feature> UI — build to design.md with placeholder data + states` |
| 3 | **Data model** | `/develop <feature> data model — <entities/tables/fields>` |
| 4 | **Backend & API** | `/develop <feature> API — <endpoints/actions/queries>` |
| 5 | **External integration** | `/develop <feature> integration — <provider/webhooks>` |
| 6 | **Data integration** (replace the mock) | `/develop <feature> wire-up — swap placeholder for real data, loading/error/empty states` |
| 7 | **Auth & permissions** | `/develop <feature> permissions — <who can do/see what>` |
| 8 | **SEO & metadata** | `/develop <feature> SEO — title/meta/OG/structured data` |
| 9 | **Validation & edge cases** | `/develop <feature> edge cases — <the failures>` |
| 10 | **Tests** | `/test <feature>` |
| 11 | **Harden** (payments/auth/admin only) | `/harden <feature>` |
| 12 | **Sync conventions** | `/sync` |

Each rendered sub-task is one checklist line: `- [ ] <sub-task name> — `\`<command + prompt>\``. The skill **and** the order **and** the prompt all live in that line — that's the "which skill, in what order, with what prompt" the breakdown must answer.

## Roadmap file structure

Write the chosen file with two parts — an overview table and the detailed breakdown:

```markdown
# Feature Roadmap

_Seeded by /roadmap · status advanced by /develop and /sync. Roadmap files live in `docs/roadmap/` (ADRs are in `docs/adr/`)._

## Overview

| # | Feature | Priority | Needs ADR? | Status | Code area |
|---|---------|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Coding standards & tooling | P0 | no | planned | — |
| 2 | Stack & architecture | P0 | yes | planned | — |
| 3 | Design system & UI foundation | P0 | yes | planned | — |
| 4 | Home page | P0 | yes | planned | — |
| 5 | Segment landing pages | P0 | yes | planned | — |
| 6 | Shop listing (filter & sort) | P0 | yes | planned | — |
| 7 | Product detail page | P0 | yes | planned | — |
| 8 | Cart | P0 | yes | planned | — |
| … | … | … | … | … | — |

<!-- Brownfield: already-built features are enrolled here above the planned ones, with status `existing`
     (complete, no breakdown) or `in-progress` (partial — finish via /develop), e.g.
| — | Auth | — | — | existing | `src/auth/` |
| — | Product catalog | — | — | existing | `src/catalog/` |
— `existing` ≠ `done`: it predates the workflow. Code area filled; complete ones get no breakdown. -->

_(Granular: home and segment landing are separate features; listing, product, and cart are separate — not one "storefront".)_

## Build order (UI-first, layered)

**Phase 1 — Foundations**: coding standards + tooling (`/audit` → `/develop`) → stack (`/architect`) → design system (`/architect` → `design.md` → base components)
**Phase 2 — All UI (placeholder data, no auth/DB)**: home → segment landing → shop listing → product → cart → checkout → account → admin — every page, static mock data + placeholder assets, browsable end to end
**Phase 3 — Data & auth foundations**: authentication → database + schema → seed data
**Phase 4 — Integration (page by page)**: wire home → segment landing → shop → product → cart → checkout → account → admin to real data + auth + actions, one at a time
**Phase 5 — Harden & test**: per feature as it goes live
_Deferred: advanced search, analytics dashboard_

## Build breakdown

### 1. Coding standards & tooling  ·  Needs ADR: no  ·  Status: planned
- [ ] Capture standards into `AGENTS.md` — `/audit` _(greenfield: pick architecture style + conventions)_
- [ ] Set up enforcement tooling — `/develop tooling — ESLint + Prettier + strict tsconfig + husky/lint-staged pre-commit, per the captured standards`
- [ ] Tests — `/test` _(lint/format run clean)_
> ADR: — (no decision — conventions captured by /audit) · Code area: —

### 4. Home page  ·  Needs ADR: yes  ·  Status: planned
- [ ] Decision (ADR) — `/architect home page — composition (hero, featured collections, segment entry points), layout, asset strategy`
- [ ] UI (placeholder data) — `/develop home page UI — build to design.md with mock collections + placeholder imagery`
- [ ] Data integration — `/develop home page wire-up — swap mock for real featured collections, loading/empty states`
- [ ] SEO & metadata — `/develop home page SEO — title/meta/OG/Organization JSON-LD`
- [ ] Tests — `/test home page`
> ADR: — · Code area: —

### 5. Segment landing pages  ·  Needs ADR: yes  ·  Status: planned
- [ ] Decision (ADR) — `/architect segment landing — per-segment layout (dev/gamer/anime), theming, shared vs unique blocks`
- [ ] UI (placeholder data) — `/develop segment landing UI — build to design.md, mock per-segment data`
- [ ] Data integration — `/develop segment landing wire-up — real segment catalog, empty states`
- [ ] SEO & metadata — `/develop segment landing SEO — per-segment title/meta/OG`
- [ ] Tests — `/test segment landing`
> ADR: — · Code area: —

### … (every feature gets its own block with filled-in prompts)

## Legend
- **Status**: `planned` → `in-progress` → `done` (pipeline: /roadmap seeds → /develop builds → /sync reconciles). Plus **`existing`** — a pre-existing feature enrolled by /roadmap for context (built before this workflow; no breakdown; `done` is reserved for pipeline-verified work). Plus **`dropped`** — a de-scoped feature kept for history (set by /roadmap on re-planning; excluded from active work; never deleted).
- **Sub-task checkbox**: `todo` `[ ]` → `done` `[x]` — `/develop` ticks its own sub-tasks as it builds; **`/sync` sweeps the rest** (`/test`, `/harden`, tooling, `/sync`) from repo evidence
- **Needs ADR?**: `yes` → run `/architect` before building · `no` → `/develop` directly
- **Priority**: P0 (MVP-critical) · P1 (MVP) · P2 (deferred)
```

## Completion report block

```
## /roadmap complete

**Product**: <one line>
**Roadmap file**: <docs/roadmap/NN-name.md> — <created new | merged into latest | new slice (next number) because <reason>>
**Existing plans read** (re-run): <N files, M features already on the roadmap — or "none (first plan)">
**Existing features enrolled** (brownfield): <count as `existing` + count as `in-progress` (partial) — or "n/a (greenfield)">
**Drift enrolled** (off-plan work found in the code/ADRs): <count — or "none">
**Scope (this plan)**: <N> NEW features to build (deduped against existing), <total sub-task count> build sub-tasks
**Cross-cutting in scope**: <SEO / analytics / i18n / compliance — or "none">
**Build order**: <feature 1> → <feature 2> → …
**First step**: <recommended next command — usually `/architect <first feature>`, or `/audit` first if brownfield has no root AGENTS.md>
